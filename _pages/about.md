My research interest is in both physics-based and data-based modeling and design of flexible structures and soft machines. My career goal is to combine computational mechanics, numerical simulations, machine learning algorithms, and autonomous robotic framework to characterize, analyze, and control the mechanical properties of complex materials and structures, then enhance the performances and enrich the functionalities of soft machines.
